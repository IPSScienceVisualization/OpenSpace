# OpenSpace Python Resources

This repository contains libraries and example code for using python to create OpenSpace visualization modules. Generator routines will create a visualization module either from an Astropy Table, or directly from a CDS http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/ catalog number providing access to tens of thousands of published astronomical catalogs

This is a package to automatically create the necessary files to visualize datasets as a Renderable Billboards Cloud in Open Space. A tutorial and examples are available.
